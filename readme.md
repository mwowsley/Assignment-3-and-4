## Homework 3 and 4 

### Weekly Recap: 
#### The purpose for this week's assignment is to develop a music page website using wordpress coding. I felt a bit unease when it came to my initial thoughts on this assignments because I did not know if I had the right files to conduct the assignments. After getting help from my groupmates and watching the video tutorials, I was able to fully work with the files to create my pages that was neccessary for both assignments. Overall, I feel as if I have a better understanding regarding the structure how wordpress operate when it comes to coding a page and the layout of it!
